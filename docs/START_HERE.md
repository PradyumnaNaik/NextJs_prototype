## 🎯 The Three Concepts You're Learning

### 1️⃣ React Server Components (RSC)
**What**: Components that run on the server
**Where**: src/lib/products.ts
**Why**: Direct database access, smaller bundles
**Time to learn**: 20-30 minutes

### 2️⃣ Server Actions
**What**: Functions callable from client, run on server
**Where**: src/lib/actions.ts
**Why**: No API routes needed, type-safe
**Time to learn**: 20-30 minutes

### 3️⃣ UI Diffs & Streaming
**What**: React efficiently updates UI, progressive rendering
**Where**: src/components/SearchBar.tsx
**Why**: Better performance, responsive UX
**Time to learn**: 30-45 minutes
